# WiiUVPlayer
RAW Video player for the Wii


# Important 
This app currently only works great on dolphin emulator, it's due to the fact read the video entirely from the storage device which is SLOW on real hardware.

This app is more of a test I did than a true homebrew, so use it at your own risk.

# How to use 

You'll need two files in order to use the app :

- "video.yuv" : A RAW video file (I used ffmpeg to make mine).

- "audio.mp3" : The audio file of the video you want to play.

These files need to be on the root of the SD card.
